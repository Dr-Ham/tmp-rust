# stats.truckersmp.com but in Rust
(or an attempt to)

The code is pretty much Spaghetti right now and some stuff might be... weird, that's due it's my first attempt at WebAssembly and many changes to the code. WHEN I have time, I'll work on improving it.

In order to make the code 'work' (aka compiled), as it needs to be 'glued' to JS, you'll need to execute the following command -> wasm-pack build --target no-modules (--debug).


Any suggestion (preferably via the TMP thread) or commit is welcome.
